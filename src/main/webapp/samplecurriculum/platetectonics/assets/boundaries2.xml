		<facts>
			<fact>At a convergent boundary between two continental plates, neither plate goes under into the mantle (because continental plates are less dense than the underlying mantle).</fact>
        	<fact>As the plates move toward each other, the crust crumples from the stress and rises up to form mountains.</fact>

		<title>What's Happening?</title>
		<facts>
			<fact>At a convergent boundary between an oceanic plate and a continental plate, the denser, heavier oceanic plate will go under the less dense, lighter continental plate.</fact>
			<fact>The subducting oceanic plate is pushed into the mantle, where it heats up and begins to melt.</fact>
			<fact>The melting process causes magma to form in the mantle.</fact>
			<fact>The magma rises through the mantle because it is less dense than the surrounding rock and builds up at the Earth’s surface.</fact>
			<fact>Once enough buildup of magma occurs, an eruption occurs and a volcano forms from cooling lava.</fact>

		<title>What's Happening?</title>
		<facts>
			<fact>At a divergent boundary between two oceanic plates, an underwater mountain range forms because of pressure from the rising magma below.  The mountain range has a deep crack called a rift valley at its top.</fact>
			<fact>As the plates move, the two sides of the mountain range are carried away from the rift valley.</fact>
			<fact>Magma wells up from the Earth's interior to fill the rift.</fact>
			<fact>The magma is rapidly cooled by the sea and solidifies into rock, creating new ocean floor.</fact>

		<title>What's Happening?</title>
		<facts>
			<fact>At a transform boundary between two continental plates, the two plates are sliding past each other.</fact>
			<fact>The two plates do not move smoothly past each other because of friction.</fact>
			<fact>When friction prevents plate movement, the energy of movement (kinetic energy) becomes “trapped” or stored at the boundary as elastic strain.</fact>
			<fact>When enough energy, or strain, builds up, the plates are able to move.</fact>
			<fact>The movement releases the stored up energy in the form of seismic waves, which result in earthquakes.</fact>
